**Security Architecture and Implementation Documentation (Internship Output)**

This repository contains high-level, non-sensitive documentation artifacts detailing the security solutions designed and implemented during a Cyber Security Engineer Internship for a non-profit web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Focus Areas**

- Secure Architecture: Implementation of a three-tier model to separate presentation, application, and data layers for improved defense-in-depth.

- Identity Management: Deployment of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and granular Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls.

- Compliance: Mitigation of OWASP Top 10 risks and adherence to data integrity best practices via Firebase Rules.

**Artifacts Included**

- iam_policy_structure.md: A template documenting the custom IAM roles created (Principle of Least Privilege).

- mfa_implementation_flow.md: A document detailing the user flow and backend logic for the MFA deployment.

- sample_security_rules.json: A structural example of the Firebase Security Rules used to protect the database.

**Professional Impact**

This work demonstrated the ability to transition from theoretical knowledge to production-level security implementation, directly protecting sensitive administrative and user data.
